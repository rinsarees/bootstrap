                    <p style="color: #ffffff;padding: 15px;">A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant.

                     Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.

                    In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. 

                  There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months</p>

                       Four basic parts
                        Flowers have four basic parts, from the outside in they are:
                              The perianth, the vegetative parts
                              The calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals. These are often green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud. They may be absent, or they may be petal-like in some species
                        
                              The corolla: the petals, usually thin, soft and often colored to attract animals that help pollination
                              The reproductive parts
                              The androecium, the male part, is the stamens
                              Although this arrangement is typical, plant species show a wide variation in floral structure.

                          The modifications produced in the evolution of flowering plants are used by botanists to find relationships among plant species.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 order-md-2 text-center" style="background-color: #F59330;">
                    <p style="color: #ffffff;padding: 15px;">
                    Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants. Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Their pollen grains are light-weight. 

                    Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen. Their pollen grains are heavier. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. These are inside what botanists call the fruit. Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal. Plants do not move, but wind, animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape.

                    Since the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains made of just three cells. One cell drills down through the integuments, to make a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down.

                     The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and forms a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of "double fertilisation" is unique, and is common to all angiosperms.
